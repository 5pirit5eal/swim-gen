### üìã Next Priority Items

#### V1 Polish & Enhancements

1. **Layout Improvements**: Header and footer should fill full page width
   - Change base layout to full width design
   - Add container elements for content width control
   - Maintain responsive design principles

2. **Settings UX Enhancement**: Replace help text with hoverable question mark icons
   - Add detailed tooltips for all filter settings
   - Explain difficulty levels, training types, and swimming techniques
   - Improve user understanding of advanced options

3. **Creative Assistance**: Add "I'm feeling lucky" sample prompt button
   - Integrate with backend endpoint for sample prompts
   - Help users who need inspiration for training requests
   - Backend endpoint needs implementation

4. **Pool Length Integration**: Include pool length in training plan requests
   - Add pool length field to the form
   - Integrate into prompt generation for more accurate plans
   - Consider common pool sizes (25m, 50m, yards)

5. **Intensity Legend**: Add hoverable help for intensity abbreviations
   - Question mark icon next to intensity column header
   - Tooltip explaining common swimming intensity abbreviations
   - Improve plan readability for new users

#### Core Features (Remaining)

- None! All core V1 features have been implemented ‚úÖ

### üîÑ Remaining V1 Tasks

#### Future Enhancements (V2 Scope)

- **Plan Customization**: Edit generated plans before export, save drafts locally
- **Testing Suite**: Unit tests, integration tests, accessibility improvements
- **Production Optimization**: Bundle analysis, asset optimization, deployment configuration
- **Advanced Features**: Custom filename generation, multiple export formats

### üéØ Implementation Notes

#### Decisions Made

- **CORS Handling**: Development proxy chosen over backend CORS configuration for V1 simplicity
- **Design System**: Mono-color approach without gradients for clean, consistent appearance
- **Loading States**: Prioritized loading animation over existing plan display for better UX
- **Mobile Support**: Deferred to V2 to focus on desktop experience first

#### Known Issues for Future

- **Elite Athlete Filter**: Backend database missing plans for elite athletes (backend issue)
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: CSS media queries removed for V1, need re-implementation
- **Plan Editing**: Architecture ready but UI implementation deferred

## Development Notes

### Learning Resources

- [Vue 3 Official Documentation](https://vuejs.org/)
