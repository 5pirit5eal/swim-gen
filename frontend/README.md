# Swim-RAG Frontend

Vue 3 + TypeScript frontend for the Swim Training Plan Generator application.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Development Commands

```sh
npm run dev          # Start development server with HMR
npm run build        # Type-check + build (runs in parallel)
npm run type-check   # TypeScript validation with vue-tsc
npm run test:unit    # Run Vitest tests in watch mode
npm run lint         # ESLint with auto-fix
npm run format       # Prettier formatting
npm run preview      # Preview production build locally
```

### Running with the BFF

To run the frontend with the BFF locally, you need to have both the backend and the BFF services running.

1. **Start the backend service** by following the instructions in the `backend/README.md` file. By default, it runs on port `8080`.
2. **Start the BFF service** by following the instructions in the `bff/README.md` file. By default, it runs on port `8081`.
3. **Start the frontend development server**:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    The `vite.config.ts` is configured to proxy requests from `/api` to the BFF service running on `http://localhost:8081`.

### Running with Docker Compose

To run the entire application stack (frontend, BFF, and backend) using Docker, you can use the `docker-compose.yml` file located in the root of the project.

1. **Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.**
2. **Navigate to the root of the `swim-gen` project.**
3. **Run the following command:**

    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This will build the Docker images for the frontend, BFF, and backend services and start them. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

The frontend application is containerized using Docker and served by Nginx. It is deployed to Google Cloud Run.

**Build and Deploy Process:**

1. **Containerization**: A multi-stage `Dockerfile` builds the Vue.js application and packages it with Nginx.
2. **Cloud Build Triggers**:
    - `main-pr.cloudbuild.yaml`: Runs linting, type-checking, and unit tests on pull requests to the `main` branch.
    - `release.cloudbuild.yaml`: Builds the Docker image, pushes it to Google Artifact Registry, and deploys the service to Cloud Run on merges to the `main` branch.
3. **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is used to define and manage the Cloud Run service and Cloud Build triggers.

### üìö Documentation & Learning

- [ ] **Document component APIs and usage patterns**
- [ ] **Create development workflow documentation**
- [ ] **Add inline code comments for learning**
- [ ] **Set up component storybook or documentation site**

### üîÆ Future Preparation (V2 Considerations)

- [ ] **Design authentication-ready architecture**
- [ ] **Plan for user session management**
- [ ] **Consider chat/history features in component design**
- [ ] **Prepare for multi-page application structure**
- [ ] **Implement client-side logging and error reporting**
