# Swim Training Plan Generator

A web application for generating, recommeding and sharing training plans for swimmers, triathletes and trainers.

## Tech Stack

The web application is hosted in Google Cloud. The following components are involved:

1. Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) to authenticate and identify users
2. Single-Page Frontend hosted in Cloud Run implemented in React
3. Backend hosted in Cloud Run implemented in Go and Langchaingo
4. PostgreSQL database (managed) with pgvector

## Roadmap

### V1: The Prototype

The initial version only contains the core concept of being able to generate individual training plans based on user input (text/form).

- **Generate TP based on user input (free form or configuration menu)**
  - Frontend displays simple one page app with text box and advanced settings
  - Backend provides endpoint for retrieval-augmented generation
  - Database contains training plans scraped from the web (tiny scope) and their embeddings
- **TP are exportable/printable as PDF**
  - Frontend includes Button for exporting PDF
  - Backend allows the user to get PDF exports of Trainingplan data
- **Requests are anonym and no user identification is necessary**
  - Authentication is omitted for v1
  - Any user information is stored encrypted if not configured otherwise
  - Frontend displays the option to not donate results in advanced settings

### V2: User-specific TPs and TP History

The next version takes lessons learned in v1 into consideration and adds user authentication and generation history, making the web application a lot more useful.

- **Generate TP based on user input (free form, configuration) and enable the user to give feedback to adapt results**
  - Builds upon the content of v1 by adding chat history in backend
- **TP are exportable as PDF, excel or odt**
- **TP can be recommended/donated**
  - Form added to frontend to input/donate your favorite training plans
  - URL input to report new scraping targets (after allowListing and configuration)
  - Request user feedback to plan after new login after previously exporting TP
  - Endpoint in backend for saving feedback
  - Notation/Abbreviations of different sources can be processed correctly
- **User authentication and identification**
  - Identity-Aware Proxy for user identification and user data persistence (TPs)
- **TP History can be viewed**
  - TPs are saved associated with user ID (JWT)
  - Frontend is extended with `History` page to view previously created TPs
- **TP can be shared via URL**
- **Enable deletion of user data**
  - Add url to soft-delete all user data at the bottom of the page
  - User data is retrievable or 30 days, then fully deleted
- **Add content required by german law**

### V3: Multimodal Generation and Community-Sharing

The third version further builds upon v1 and v2 by adding more input options for generating or donating TPs, and creating a searchable community forum of previously created and liked TPs. This also allows user interaction, such as comments, likes and tagging.
Additionally, an anonymous mode is added which enables new users to test the application in a similar way to how v1 works.

## Todos

Replace langchain go with custom implementation, or fork and adapt:

[ ] AddDocuments
[ ] Similarity Search
[ ] Embedding single document and inferring with single document
